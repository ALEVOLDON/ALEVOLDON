I am a novice developer, I have no work experience yet. At the moment, I am developing a platform for searching for meetings.

I want to work remotely in a company, learn and develop, hone my skills and transfer to others.

Recently I am interested in motion design (cinema 4d), 3D animation, libraries such as three.js and p5.js, Web Audio API. I have a lot of experience in sound design.
