I am seeking a remote role as a Motion Designer in a creative agency where I can utilize my expertise in Cinema 4D, 3D animation, and libraries such as Three.js and p5.js. I have a strong background in sound design, as well as experience in web development and a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design. I am excited to continue honing my skills and sharing my knowledge with the team.
